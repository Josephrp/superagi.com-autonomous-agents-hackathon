Atomic Tonic - Super AGI Autonomous Agents Hackathon GitHub Repository.

## WHAT WE DO : Multi Agent SuperAGI Environments With One Click Deploy and NO CODE  

## Step by Step : 

0. On a computer currently running docker:

1. Basically download pinokio here :

www.pinokio.computer

download the version for your OS.

2. install this .

3. in the "search bar" at the top in pinokio paste super agi github url :

https://github.com/TransformerOptimus/SuperAGI

4. click on discover, paste the same url again, click download.

5. open the repository to find the folder you just downloaded and open it.

6. download each of the scripts from https://github.com/Josephrp/superagi_pinokio individually.

7. into that folder using the system navigator : copy from your download folder and paste the files as is in the folder. 

8. refresh pinokio (close and restart, navigate to your folder and click run for each of the install files then click run to run the run file (as described below - please read!).

#### Congratulations your computer is now a superAGI API with full functionality. You can make single or multi agent environments communicate like this :

https://docs.pinokio.computer/api/networking.html

Not everything we built made it into the repo. We also hacked the pinokio browser itself , we also worked on multi and single agent scenarios. The project lives on in our near term roadmap : networked super agi deployments on cloud quickly, without code and with full functionality in the hands of exactly every single professional. 


## Script instructions ##

IMPORTANT!: You must first have docker installed.

1. run the file labelled `install.json`

2. run the file `runsuperagipinokio.json`

3. Go to localhost to view your superagi instance.


##  Deploy on Cloud 

#### Install (as yet "unreleased" 8/19/2023 From Cocktail Peanut ) Pinokio.Computer in AWS :

git clone https://github.com/pinokiocomputer/pinokiod

cd pinokiod

npm install

npm start

then use pinokio here : 

open http://localhost:4200/

### Modify your pinokio Browser to point to your SuperAGI-Pinokio Instance by replacing "Localhost" with your public IP (port :4200)

## Click Run to Run
